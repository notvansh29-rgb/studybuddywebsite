// Fallback explanations for Demo Mode
const DEMO_EXPLANATIONS: Record<string, { summary: string; analogy: string; keyPoints: string[]; example: string; takeaway: string }> = {
  'photosynthesis': {
    summary: 'Photosynthesis is the biochemical process where green plants, algae, and cyanobacteria transform sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose (energy-rich sugar) and oxygen.',
    analogy: 'Imagine a solar-powered kitchen inside every leaf! Sunlight is the electricity, carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil are the raw ingredients, and the chef creates sweet glucose snacks while giving away fresh oxygen as a free gift to the planet.',
    keyPoints: [
      'Chemical equation: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light Energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂',
      'Occurs primarily in chloroplasts containing green chlorophyll pigment',
      'Comprises two main stages: Light-dependent reactions (in thylakoids) and the Calvin Cycle (in stroma)',
      'Provides the foundational energy source for nearly all food webs on Earth'
    ],
    example: 'A sunflower in your backyard turns sunlight hitting its leaves into the chemical energy it needs to grow 10 feet tall and produce hundreds of nutritious sunflower seeds.',
    takeaway: 'Photosynthesis converts solar radiant energy into stable chemical bonds, sustaining Earth\'s oxygen supply and biomass.'
  },
  'newtons laws': {
    summary: 'Sir Isaac Newton formulated three fundamental laws of motion that describe how physical objects interact with forces and move through space.',
    analogy: 'Think of a skateboard: it won\'t move until you kick it (1st Law). The harder you kick or the lighter your board, the faster you accelerate (2nd Law: F=ma). When you push backward against the ground, the ground pushes you forward with identical force (3rd Law).',
    keyPoints: [
      '1st Law (Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted on by an external net force.',
      '2nd Law (F = ma): Net Force equals mass times acceleration.',
      '3rd Law (Action-Reaction): For every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force.',
      'Forms the foundation of classical mechanics and aerospace engineering'
    ],
    example: 'When a rocket launches into space, burning propellant is forced downward out of the thrusters at high speed (action), driving the massive rocket upward into orbit (reaction).',
    takeaway: 'Forces never occur alone; motion changes strictly when unbalanced external forces act upon a mass.'
  },
  'pythagorean theorem': {
    summary: 'The Pythagorean Theorem states that in any right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side opposite the 90° angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.',
    analogy: 'If you built square tile patios along each of the three sides of a right triangle, the number of tiles needed to pave the two smaller patios combined would exactly equal the tiles needed for the giant patio on the longest side (a² + b² = c²).',
    keyPoints: [
      'Mathematical formula: a² + b² = c² (where c is the hypotenuse)',
      'Only applies to triangles with a 90-degree angle',
      'Common Pythagorean triples: (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (8, 15, 17)',
      'Essential for GPS navigation, construction, architecture, and computer graphics'
    ],
    example: 'If a ladder rests 6 feet away from the base of a wall and touches the wall 8 feet high, the ladder must be √(6² + 8²) = √(36 + 64) = √100 = 10 feet long.',
    takeaway: 'Connects the geometry of right angles directly to algebraic distances.'
  },
  'machine learning': {
    summary: 'Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence where computer algorithms learn patterns directly from data and improve their performance automatically without being explicitly programmed with manual rules.',
    analogy: 'Instead of writing a 10,000-rule handbook telling a computer what every dog breed looks like, you show it 100,000 photos of dogs and cats. Over time, the model adjusts its internal mathematical dials until it can recognize dogs on its own.',
    keyPoints: [
      'Supervised Learning: Trained on labeled input-output pairs (e.g. email spam vs not spam)',
      'Unsupervised Learning: Discovers hidden groupings without predefined labels (e.g. customer segmentation)',
      'Reinforcement Learning: Learns through rewards and trial-and-error actions in an environment',
      'Powers recommendation systems, medical diagnostics, self-driving vehicles, and voice assistants'
    ],
    example: 'Streaming platforms like Spotify or Netflix analyze songs and shows you enjoyed in the past to recommend new songs you will likely love tonight.',
    takeaway: 'Traditional code follows fixed rules; machine learning builds the rules by discovering patterns in historical data.'
